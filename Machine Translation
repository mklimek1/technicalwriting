## What is Machine Translation in General?

Machine Translation (MT) or automated translation happens when a computer software translates text from one language to another **without human involvement**.

### How does Machine Translation Work?

MT works with large amounts of source and target languages that are compared and matched against each other by a machine translation engine. There are three types of machine translation methods:

- **Rules-based machine translation**
uses grammar and language rules, developed by language experts, and dictionaries which can be customized to a specific topic or industry.
- **Statistical machine translation**
  does not rely on linguistic rules and words; it learns how to translate by analyzing large amount of existing human translations.
- **Neural machine translation**
  teaches itself on how to translate by using a large neural network. This method is becoming more and more popular as it provides better results with language pairs.

#### What are the benefits of Machine Translation?

- **Saves time**: Machine language translation can save a lot of time as it can translate entire text documents in seconds, but bear in mind that human translators should always post-edit translations done by MTs.
- **Reduces costs**: Machine Translation can lower your costs, as it requires less human involvement.
- **Memorizes items**: Another benefit of machine language translation is its ability to memorize key terms and reuse them if they might fit.
